    description: 'Thanks to its handy pocket size and the built-in rechargeable battery
      (500 mAh). Extra security: The built-in gyroscope turns the light off when the
      LED is turned upside down. So that the user cannot see directly into the UV
      LED. (Direct UV-C light eye contact can injure the eyes)'

    description: 'The Charge & CleanStation ProUV disinfects your cell phone, keys,
      mask, etc. quickly, effectively and in an environmentally friendly way (without
      adding chemicals or releasing ozone) - the separation of disinfection and inductive
      charging (10W) is particularly interesting because after disinfecting the cell
      phone, this e.g. can be charged overnight and other items of daily use can be
      disinfected at the same time. (also other cell phones ...) - Safety function:
      When the cover is lifted (which also works separately as a wireless charger)
      the UV light switches off automatically. (Direct UV-C light eye contact can
      damage the eyes)'
